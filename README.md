Rebounder
=========

This is a game I wrote for iPhone and iPad using [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/). Unfortunately I couldn't include all the code because NGUI and 2D Toolkit are not free.

While the game was designed for iPhone, Unity3D is a multi platform engine so it will run on other platforms. OS X, Windows and web versions can be found in the Executables folder.

I've written a [series of blog posts](http://www.philjhale.com/2014/08/ive-made-game.html) about Rebounder.

Rebounder was made using the following:
* Unity 4.5.0
* 2D Toolkit 2.3.0
* NGUI 3.6.1
* iTween 2.0.46.1
* GameAnalytics 0.6.4
